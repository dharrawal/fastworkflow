"""check_cache_freshness.py — recompute the v2.22.1 source fingerprint and
compare it to the fingerprints stamped inside ___command_info/*.json.

Background (commit b5747df, v2.22.1): command_directory.json and
routing_definition.json are derived snapshots of the _commands/ tree. Each is
stamped with `source_fingerprint` = sha256 over the sorted list of
(absolute_path, size, mtime_ns) of every contributing source file:
  * <workflow>/_commands/**/*.py (recursively)
  * _commands/**/context_inheritance_model.json
  * the same for every base workflow named in workflow_inheritance_model.json
  * <workflow>/context_hierarchy_model.json (if present)
At load time fastworkflow trusts a snapshot ONLY if its stamp matches the
recomputed fingerprint; otherwise it silently rebuilds the JSON (cheap).
The trained MODELS (tinymodel.pth etc.) are NOT fingerprint-guarded — a stale
fingerprint tells you the JSONs will rebuild, and it is also your cue that the
command set may have drifted from what the classifier was trained on.

This script explains the verdict instead of just printing hashes:
  FRESH   — stamp == live fingerprint; snapshots will be trusted as-is
  STALE   — mismatch; next fastworkflow load rebuilds the JSON snapshots.
            Models are only retrained by an explicit `fastworkflow train`.
  LEGACY  — snapshot exists but has no source_fingerprint field (pre-v2.22.1);
            treated as not-fresh, forces rebuild
  MISSING — snapshot file absent (workflow never built, or info dir deleted)

Because the fingerprint embeds ABSOLUTE paths and mtime_ns, all of these
invalidate it even with byte-identical sources: moving the workflow directory,
a fresh git checkout, Docker COPY, `touch`. That is safe-by-design (a spurious
rebuild costs ~seconds, a trusted-stale snapshot costs an import error) but it
explains most "why did it rebuild?" surprises.

Usage:
    .venv/bin/python .claude/skills/fastworkflow-diagnostics-and-tooling/scripts/check_cache_freshness.py <workflow_dir> [--json]

READ-ONLY: never writes; avoids fastworkflow helpers that mkdir.
