"""Uncertainty signals at the NLU resolution boundary (bead fix-ajv.4).

EXP-003 Phase 0 is instrumentation: the runtime records how unsure it was and
routes exactly as it did before. Both halves need proof, and they need different
kinds of proof.

*What is recorded* is checked against real components (testing_rules.mdc): the
trained ``fastworkflow/examples/hello_world`` workflow drives the real matching
layers, the real ``find_best_matches`` scores real candidates, and the real
embedding cache is exercised with the real DistilBERT pipeline. The assembling
functions are pure functions of the capture bag, so most tiers can be covered
without a model at all — which is the point of building them that way.

*That nothing reads what is recorded* is checked statically, in the same spirit as
``test_decision_signals.py::test_module_defines_no_decision_function``. The rule
enforced here is narrower than "no conditional anywhere" and deliberately so: a
recorder has to read facts to shape a record. What may never happen is a captured
*measurement* — a confidence, a distance, a similarity, an assembled
``DecisionUncertainty`` — being compared against anything, or used as a truth
value. A ``x is None`` presence check cannot express a threshold and is allowed;
``<``, ``>``, ``==`` and bare truthiness can, and are not.

The polarity trap has its own test. ``find_best_matches`` returns a normalized
Levenshtein DISTANCE where lower is a better match, while architecture §6.6.1
names the kind ``fuzzy-score``. A consumer that reads the direction off the name
inverts every curve drawn from it, so the direction is asserted here against real
matcher output rather than trusted to the field name.
