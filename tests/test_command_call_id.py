"""Durable CommandOutput-to-span correlation (arch §12.0 delta 1, §12.1 item 5).

Before `command_call_id` there was no join at all between a command's outcome and
its trace: `fw.command.execute` carried a random uuid4 that nothing else knew, and
`CommandOutput` carried no id, so a reader holding a turn's `record_json` could
only guess which span produced which outcome from ordering and timestamps. These
tests are about that join actually working end to end, and about the two ways it
can look right and be useless:

* an id that is stamped on the span but not on the outcome (or the reverse), which
  reads as correlation and joins nothing;
* an id minted twice for one execution — once by the dispatcher and once by the
  span emitter — which produces two plausible ids per command and matches neither.

The child-call ledger gets the same treatment. An application command is reached
only through an internal CME `perform_action` hop, which may dispatch a further
core command; those inner calls have no spans, so if their ids are not filed under
the enclosing call they are simply lost.

`tests/test_no_capture_control_flow.py` holds the structural half — that nothing
branches on any of this. It is a separate file because it reads source rather than
running workflows.

Fixtures follow tests/test_tracing_phase1.py and
tests/test_conversation_turn_summary_content.py: the real todo_list_workflow, the
real WorkflowExecutionContext, the real CommandExecutor, and a real TraceSink
implementation. The only stand-in is at the NLU boundary, because the test
workflows ship no trained intent models — and it is a stand-in that performs a
REAL nested dispatch rather than returning a canned result, since the nesting is
the thing under test.
