"""Golden parity for every public shape (arch §12.2).

§12.2 is a promise about four models: `CommandResponse`, `CommandOutput` and
`TurnOutput` stay compatible, and `TurnResult` grows only additively. A promise
nothing checks is a promise a well-meant refactor breaks silently, and the cost
lands on a reader months later — by which time the records that lost a field
have already been written and cannot be repaired.

So every shape's serialized field set is pinned here, in declaration order.
Order rather than a bare set, because "additive" is exactly the claim: a field
appended at the end grows the record, a field inserted in the middle or renamed
does not, and only the ordered pin can tell those apart.

The pins are on NAMES and STRUCTURE, never on values. No turn key, timestamp,
duration, call id or digest is asserted, because a golden test that fails
whenever the clock moves gets deleted rather than read.

Three kinds of test, each catching something the others cannot:

* **Field-set pins** catch a rename, a removal, or a non-appended addition.
* **Round trips** catch a field that serializes but cannot be read back. The
  `ask_user` role inversion [A7] gets its own, because there
  `command_parameters` holds the agent's *question* as a `str` and the response
  holds the user's *answer*; so does the typed-model-to-dict asymmetry
  `CommandOutput`'s docstring calls [A10] honesty — in memory the value is a
  workflow's Pydantic params instance, in a record it is a dict, and restore
  must accept both without either shape lying about the other.
* **Cross-version compatibility** catches the two directions that actually
  break deployments: an older record (no `command_call_id`, no
  `execution_records`, no `routing_events`) read by today's model, and a newer
  record carrying a key today's model has never heard of.

Real components throughout, per `.cursor/rules/testing_rules.mdc`: the
parameters class comes from the real `todo_list_workflow` through the
framework's own `RoutingRegistry`, and the end-to-end pin runs a real
`WorkflowExecutionContext` against a real `TodoListManager`.
